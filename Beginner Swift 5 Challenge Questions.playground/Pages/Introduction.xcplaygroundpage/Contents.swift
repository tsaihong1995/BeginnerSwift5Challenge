 # Beginner Swift 5 Challenge
 It's really important to assess how much you understand about code when you are only just a beginner. It's easy to fall into the trap that you are learning when in fact you are cramming. The real challenge for many beginners is how to describe an issue in code. It takes time to get there and what helps is practice.
 
 You are not expected to get everything correct in this challenge. It's fine to get everything wrong - what matters is your perseverance and patience in learning code. Your experience in going through this challenge is designed to give you an idea of what problem solving in code looks like. The challenges you will solve in this playground also mimic code interview style questions.
 
 ## Instructions
 1. For the best results do not Google for the answers. You might find a way to solve the challenge using a coding concept we haven't yet learnt about. It's fine however to look back at past videos to refresh yourself on certain concepts.
 2. There is more than one way to solve most of the challenges. All solutions will only using what we have learnt so far. Therefore, if you meet challenges that could be solved with higher order functions for example, we will use a simple for loop instead because we have not yet covered higher order functions.
 3. I have provided a way to test your solution to a challenge. This will help you debug your solution if you get stuck.
 4. Please do not look in the Source folder. In some challenges I have added the test code to the Source folder becuase the actual test gives away the solution!

 ## Tips For Code Problem Solving
 1. Break down a big problem into smaller parts.
 2. Use pseudo code to mentally map out the steps to solving a problem. Pseudo code is the steps you would take to solve the problem in plain english.
 3. Don't worry about semantics or making your code look elegant. Solve the problem first, even in a very brute force way, and then worry about getting the semantics right. We call this refactoring.
