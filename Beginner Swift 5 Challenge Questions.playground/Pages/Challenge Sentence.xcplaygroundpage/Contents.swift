 ## Challenge
 Complete the function `makeSentence` that takes a String array `words` as a parameter and returns a single String or sentence. Make sure that there is whitespace between the words in your final sentence but no whitespace at the beginning or end of your sentence. For example, the array, `["The", "boy", "jumped."]` should become, "The boy jumped." Assume you do not need to worry about punctuation.
